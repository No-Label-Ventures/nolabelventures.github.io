faq:
  - question: Why do you invest in immigrant founders in Europe?
    answer: We believe that investing in European immigrant-founded startups is an
      over-performing, yet often overlooked, strategy. In the US, 55% of
      unicorns are founded by immigrants, compared to 25% in Europe. As the
      European tech ecosystem matures over the next decade, we predict that two
      out of three new unicorns will be founded by immigrants. The UK, Europe's
      most mature tech ecosystem, already has 36% of its unicorns founded by
      immigrants, up from 14% a decade ago.
  - question: Do all members of the founding team need to be immigrants for you to
      invest?
    answer: No, we only require one founder in the team to be an immigrant.
  - question: What is your definition of "immigrant" in Europe?
    answer: We support immigrants in Western Europe, who have migrated from any
      country outside of Western Europe. We back first and second-generation
      immigrants.
  - question: When is the right time for a founder to reach out to No Label Ventures?
    answer: It's never too early for founders to reach out to us. We frequently
      collaborate with founders who are still employed, working on an idea,
      looking for a co-founder, or building a minimum viable product (MVP). We
      often invest before a product or revenue is generated.
  - question: How do you help founders?
    answer: We invest capital and make beneficial introductions to the founders we
      back, namely to angels, VCs and corporate clients (typically Private
      Equity owned enterprises).
  - question: What immigration support do you provide? How much will it cost founders?
    answer: We're the only VC fund in the UK and Europe to help the founders we back
      in every step of the visa process. We partner with a top law firm to
      ensure our founders get the best visa under UK & EU regs. We cover all
      visa costs & provide this service free of charge â€“ it's part of our
      value-add to founders.
  - question: In which sectors do you invest?
    answer: We are sector agnostic.
  - question: What are you looking for in a startup?
    answer: We are seeking exceptional founders. Those who have the vision and
      ability to build startups that can become very large companies in 5, 7 or
      10 years. And those founders with a unique and unconventional view on the
      future of the industry or the problem they are tackling.
  - question: Do you invest in startups based outside of Western Europe?
    answer: We are currently focusing on immigrant founders who are already in
      Western Europe and creating startups there.
  - question: How much do you usually invest in one round?
    answer: We invest between $150k and $250k in each round, and can often invest
      more in collaboration with our investors/limited partners. We are also
      able to provide follow-on investments.
  - question: Do you lead investment rounds, or do you co-invest with other VCs?
    answer: We co-invest with other VCs. In fact, we often help the founders we back
      raise capital from VCs who lead rounds. We lead by "conviction"; that is,
      we are often the first to invest in a round, helping other investors build
      conviction in the founders we support.
