Whether it comes to job prospects or studies, immigrants are renowned for being hard workers. It’s no wonder when these are people that have travelled across the world to make a new and better life for themselves. It would seem that the same goes for immigrant entrepreneurs who set out to build a business in a foreign country. In 2016, [The National Foundation for American Policy](https://www.immigrationresearch.org/system/files/Immigrants-and-Billion-Dollar-Startups.NFAP-Policy-Brief.March-2016.pdf) found that more than half (44 of 87) of America’s unicorns were started by immigrants. Below are the main factors that contribute to the overperformance of immigrant founders. 

## 1 Immigrant Founders have a Competitive Advantage

### International Ties

Immigrant founders are able to overperform due to their international ties that give them a competitive advantage over native founders. A company that only caters to its domestic market can only go so far. Immigrant founders understand how important it is for the growth of their business, to trade on the global market. With access to an established international network, immigrant founders are going to have the upper hand when branching out to a foreign market. [**STATS**]

### Unique Market Opportunities

Another reason that immigrant entrepreneurs overperform is because they take advantage of their personal experience. Their situation allows them to identify unique market opportunities that would fly under a native entrepreneur’s radar. If the immigrant entrepreneur comes from a particular ethnic group, their community would be the best target audience for a product or service that isn’t available in the host country. Their situation might allow them to see the benefits of operating in an underserved market. They may even see a need for their business to fill back in their home country and then set out to open branches abroad. 

## 2 The Immigrant Mindset

### A Risk-Taker Mindset

Uprooting your life and moving to a different country is associated with a lot of risk. Anyone who has taken the big leap will tell you that there’s a lot more to it than just getting to grips with a new language. The first year can be an administrative nightmare as you grow accustomed to the new institutional environment. However, people who migrate of their own volition are prepared to risk their livelihood for the prospect of a better life. Determined to maximise their income, immigrant founders are more willing to set out on the venture of setting up a business because they have already taken one of the biggest risks. In 2014, a report by [Centre for Entrepreneurs and DueDil](https://centreforentrepreneurs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/MigrantEntrepreneursWEB.pdf) found that 17.2% of non-UK national start their own companies as opposed to the 10.4% UK nationals. 

### A Growth Mindset

An individual that has a ‘growth mindset’ believes that their talent and abilities aren’t inherent but can be developed through hard work and persistence. Making the decision to leave everything you know requires a great deal of confidence in your ability to adapt to change. While seemingly unsurmountable at first, immigrants overcome the adversity and grow as a result of doing so. Being equipped with this mindset means that immigrant founders adapt to any change that affects their business, continuously look to improve their product or service and adapt to new market trends in order to remain competitive. 

### An Innovative Mindset

Immigrant founders tend to have weak social embeddedness compared to native founders. The concept maintains that entrepreneurs build social networks that affect their business decisions. These social networks can grant an entrepreneur access to support and resources. This means that immigrant entrepreneurs are pushed to be more innovative and find solutions to make their venture work. Thinking outside the box and continuously seeking ways to improve is crucial for a start-up to remain competitive. In 2018, a study conducted by the [National Foundation for American Policy](https://nfap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2018-BILLION-DOLLAR-STARTUPS.NFAP-Policy-Brief.2018-1.pdf) revealed that 82% of America’s unicorns in 2018, had at least one immigrant helping the company grow and innovate by filling a key management or product development position. 



It's no surprise that immigrant founders overperform. Being in a position to uncover unique market opportunities and leverage their international ties, immigrant founders can tap into a niche and be prepared to trade it on the global market. The experience of moving to a foreign country has lead these individuals to develop a mindset that is a gem for entrepreneurship. It allows them to remain hardworking, be adaptable to change and continuously strive for innovation.
