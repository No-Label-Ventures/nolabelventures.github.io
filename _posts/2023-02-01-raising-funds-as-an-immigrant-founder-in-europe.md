Raising funds for your start-up is a full-time job but it’s something that has to be done if you wish to scale your business. Start-ups in Europe reached a record breaking $37.6 billion in venture capital investment by the end of 2021’s second quarter, according to **[Crunchbase News](https://news.crunchbase.com/business/europe-vc-funding-q1-2022-monthly-recap/)**. However, it would seem that first and second generation immigrants experience difficulties in raising capital despite being a driving force behind the European economy. Here is a guide to raising funds as an immigrant founder in Europe. 

## 1 Hurdles for Immigrant Founders

There are numerous ways to raise fund for your business, however, most start-ups to choose to do so via angel funds, venture capital funds and government schemes. The **[Migrant Founders Monitor 2022](https://www.freiheit.org/germany/migrant-founders-monitor)** found that out 36% of all start-ups in Germany, 43% of first generation immigrant founders reveal facing difficulties accessing the main financing options.

### Angel Funds:

Raising funds in early stage is tough for founders who have not developed their network. It’s even harder for immigrants who have the extra work of overcoming their ecosystem’s cultural barriers. Having a network is vital for accessing advice and identifying investors that are a right fit for you. When it comes to angle funds, it takes time to source someone that is perfect for you and build a relationship with them. The **[FSB Unlock Opportunities Report 2021](https://www.fsb.org.uk/resource-report/unlock.html)** found that in response to the exclusionary nature of their environment, founders from an ethnic minority tend to build ‘informal networks’ with members of their community. While the support they gain from this can be invaluable, they lose out on networking with the formal financial system’s important players. 

### Venture Capital Funds: 

One of the main problems for immigrant founders when it comes to venture Capital firms is that there is a large number of homogenous teams. **[British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) 2021](https://www.bvca.co.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Research/2021%2520Reports/BVCA%2520Diversity%2520and%2520Inclusion%2520Report%2520-%2520Online.pdf)** surveyed venture capital companies across the UK and Europe. Among the firms’ staff, 80% were White compared to 16% who were Asian, Black or Mixed-race. Unfortunately, one of the ways in which investors mitigate the risk of their investment is by investing in businesses that they can relate to, which more often than not, belong to a similar demographic. Furthermore, immigrant founders find niche business ideas that feed needs from their community. Sometimes these ideas are simply too early for the market for investors to trust. 

### Government Initiatives:

In Europe, there are schemes in place to help under-represented founders raise funds for their business. However, immigrant founders do not receive the same level of support as other under-represented founders. [**OECD** **Missing Entrepreneurs 2021**](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/71b7a9bb-en/1/3/2/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/71b7a9bb-en&_csp_=d8d0020b2c4308e7c5bf88c928ccd139&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#figure-d1e8496)reported the unweighted average of policy assessment scores for EU member states. The 2020 survey found that immigrant entrepreneurship schemes, led by EU Member States, are less developed than other inclusive entrepreneurship schemes. In fact, the immigrant-focused schemes received the lowest score on grants for business creation, loan guarantees and microfinancing. 

## 2 The Way Forward for Immigrant Founders

### Step One: Time It Right

You need to look at your current situation and decide whether now is the right time to raise funds for your start-up. If you want your start-up to even be considered by investors, you will need to demonstrate that your product will benefit consumers and that it produces revenue. If your product isn’t ready, it might be worth looking into other financing options such as crowdfunding, merchandising, sponsorship or even donations. 

### Step Two: Preparation Is Key

Raising funds will take up all of your time, which is why it’s important that your team is aware of the work it involves and are capable of taking on your share of the work. Once you have reached out to investors, it is vital that you are prepared to pitch to the ones that get back to you.

You will also want to carefully research investors to ensure that you are approaching people who understand your vision and believe in your business model.
