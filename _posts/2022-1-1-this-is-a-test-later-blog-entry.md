Here at No Label Ventures, we are pursuing a new and unique opportunity in the European market. We are confident that immigrants, people of colour and women make the best entrepreneurs.

While the OECD observed immigrants accounting for a growing share of the self-employed in the EU, this\
entrepreneurial talent is often overlooked when it comes to investment decisions. No Label Ventures’ founder-focused approach will provide under-represented entrepreneurs with the support to overcome obstacles that are unique to them and achieve those high returns. Here are five reasons why this is the perfect time for No Label Ventures’ overperforming strategy.

\
**1 Future Underrepresented Founders in European Market**\
It has become clear that having a diverse pool of talent will lead to increased innovation and problem-solving capabilities in an organisation. With this push towards more diversity, the European market is set to experience a surge in underrepresented founders. Top universities are eager to admit students from different backgrounds. The University of Oxford alone saw a +212% increase in black students between 2016 and 2020. It comes as no surprise when employers are pushing for more diverse workforces. For example, the number of black tech employees at Google increased by x1.7 between 2019 and 2022. As for Goldman Sachs, 63% of the talent that the firm attracted to its 2020 campus analyst class in the Americas was ethnically diverse.

\
**2 Diverse Founding Teams Perform Better**\
Diverse founding teams have a lot of potential that firms in Europe simply aren’t tapping into. In fact, our research shows that diverse founding teams raise at - 14% lower valuation and -24% in their initial rounds. However, when measured by their ability to raise $500m+, these teams appear to perform up to 70% better than homogenised teams, have smaller odds of going bankrupt and a +10% higher chance of holding an IPO. Our research has also shown that 36% of unicorns in the UK were founded by non-EU 1st and 2nd generation immigrant founders. Unshackled and One Way are two venture capital firms that have taken advantage of the US’ pool of under-represented entrepreneurs and have made a success of it.

\
**3 Immigration is an Asset**\
You will not find a venture capital firm in Europe that supports entrepreneurs facing immigration challenges. No Label Ventures provides promising entrepreneurs with visa sponsorship, helping the gain access to funding and paying salaries. Over the last two decades, the growth of immigration in Europe has surpassed that of the growth seen in the US. Due to their tolerance for risk and competitive advantage in building global companies, immigrants truly make the best entrepreneurs. Europe’s rise in immigration is only going to increase the\
share of future immigrant entrepreneurs in Europe, making a positive impact on the level of entrepreneurship in the region over the coming decades.

**4 Growth of Europe’s Tech Ecosystems**\
The start-up and venture capital ecosystem in Europe is coming out of its infancy. Europe’s start-up activity only really gained momentum between the years of 2012 and 2016. While it usually takes up to 15 years for a start-up to exit successfully, the global pandemic pushed large firms to invest in digital start-ups. We are now seeing strong tech ecosystems across the region including London, Paris and Berlin.

\
**5 Increased Founder Exits in Europe**\
DEEP Ecosystem reveal that Europe experienced a +89% rise in the number of successful exits in 2021. This considerable increase will lead to more European founders reinvesting their capital in new start-ups. Whether they have been successful or not with their endeavours, they can use their acquired experience to train future founders, driving more growth in Europe’s ecosystem.

**(Conclusion)**\
Here at No Label Ventures, we are seizing a unique opportunity in the market. A lot of the investment decisions that are being made are overlooking a vital source of entrepreneurial talent. If you are an underrepresented founder in Europe or if you are interested in investing, you can pitch to us here.
